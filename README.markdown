Bloodhound
==========

Simple key:value string conversion to hashes, with type casting.

    require "bloodhound"

    hound = Bloodhound.new
    hound.add_search_field(:name,   :string)
    hound.add_search_field(:age,    :integer)
    hound.add_search_field(:active, :boolean)

    attributes = hound.attributes_from('name:"John Doe" age:22 active:yes')
    attributes #=> { "name" => "John Doe", "age" => 22, "active" => true }

The available types are `:string` (the default), `:integer`, `:float`, `:date`,
`:time`, and `:boolean`. Any other type is treated as a string.

It matches several values as boolean values. 'yes', 'y', and 'true' are all
mapped to `true`, while 'no', 'n', and 'false' are mapped to `false`.

You can customize the hash key returned:

    hound.add_search_field(:user, :string, "users.name")

    attributes = hound.attributes_from('user:"John Doe"')
    attributes #=> { "users.name" => "John Doe" }

It can match dates and times, using [Chronic](http://github.com/mojombo/chronic),
so this is valid:

    hound.add_search_field(:added, :date, "added_on")

    attributes = hound.attributes_from("added:today")
    attributes #=> { "added_on" => Date.today }

Finally, you can also provide processing rules for the parsed value, by passing
a block:

    hound.add_search_field(:inactive, :boolean, "active") {|value| not value }

    attributes = hound.attributes_from("inactive:true")
    attributes #=> { "active" => false }

ActiveRecord integration
------------------------

    require "bloodhound/active_record"

    class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend Bloodhound::Searchable
      named_scope :search, lambda {|query| bloodhound.attributes_from(query) }
    end

The ActiveRecord implementation will automatically define search fields for all
non-id, non-timestamp columns (ie, all except for `id` and `foo_id`).

You can, of course, add those in manually if you need them.

The syntax for defining attributes is a bit more rails-esque:

    class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend Bloodhound::Searchable
      search_field :user, :type => :string, :attribute => "users.login"
    end

The return value of `ActiveRecord::Bloodhound#attributes_from` changes a bit,
and returns a hash directly compatible with ActiveRecord:

    attributes = Video.bloodhound.attributes_from("user:foca")
    attributes #=> { :conditions => { "users.login" => "foca" } }

Any extra options you pass to `search_field` are added into the finder options:

    class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend Bloodhound::Searchable
      search_field :user, :attribute => "users.login", :joins => :user

      belongs_to :user
    end

    attributes = Video.bloodhound.attributes_from("user:foca")
    attributes #=> { :joins => :user,
                     :conditions => { "users.login" => "foca" } }

Install it
----------

    gem install bloodhound

For the active record interface:

    config.gem "bloodhound", :lib => "bloodhound/active_record"

Known problems
--------------

* Chronic is a bitâ€¦ weird matching some stuff, specially regarding time zones.
* The ActiveRecord 'extra options' won't merge. So if you define two search
  fields with ':joins => :an_association', only the latter will remain. This
  will be fixed in a future release.
